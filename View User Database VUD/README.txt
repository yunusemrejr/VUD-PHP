Hello there! I'm YEV.
Before you go ahead and test it out, I want to mention some important details about my program V.U.D.
As you may have guessed, you need a server to run the program. I used XAMPP (apache, mySQL etc.) as my localhost
while I was programming and testing my code. You may want to use it to test too.

*PHP Warnings

You will see a lot of PHP warnings when you load the index.php file. These warnings are due to undeclared variables
that PHP tries to make a connection with. When you click the buttons to save and run the connection, the warnings
will get replaced with actual SQL table data.

Enjoy!
